React Hooks and State Management

React Hooks are a powerful feature that allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components.

useState is the most basic hook that lets you add state to functional components.

useEffect handles side effects like data fetching and subscriptions. It replaces componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

useContext provides a way to share values between components without prop drilling.

Custom Hooks let you extract component logic into reusable functions.

State Management in larger apps often requires libraries like Redux or Zustand.

Server-Side Rendering with React can improve performance and SEO.

Next.js is a popular framework that enables SSR with React and includes many optimizations out of the box.
